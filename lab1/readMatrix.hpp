** Description:  The header file of readMatrix() function, which has two 
                 parameters: a pointer to a 2D array and an integer as the 
                 size of the matrix. It prompts the user for all the numbers 
                 within the matrix, which means for 2x2 matrix, it asks the 
                 user for 4 numbers, and 9 numbers for a 3x3 matrix. And 
                 because the function takes a pointer to the 2D array, it 
                 doesn't return anything.
